## Technologies Used

I've used React.js as a front-end, and firebase as a back-end services for this project. This project mainly focused on cloning the WhatsApp Chat messaging system and Google Authentication. For the database and Google Authentication, I've used the Cloud firestore and firebase google auth provider.

## Features

<ul>
    <li>Real time chatting</li>
    <li>Google Authentication</li>
    <li>Chat room creation</li>
</ul>

## Running Locally

<ol>
<li>You need to setup your firebase project from the https://console.firebase.google.com/</li>
<li>Once done, you need to add new app in your firebase project, then only you can able to get the Firebase SDK snippet. Copy the firebaseConfig.</li>
<li>After that, you need to setup .env file at the root of this react.js project folder.</li>
</ol>
